                                Around twenty thousand years ago, during the last glacial maximum, Norway was completely glaciated. An enormous ice sheet covered Scandinavia and reached most of Northern Europe. The Scandinavian ice sheet was much larger than the 
                                ice sheet covering Greenland today, but similar in many ways. As global warming increases, it is vital to understand 
                                how large scale ice sheet moves, flows and reacts. It is of special importance to understand how accurate our models
                                and predictions can be. What will Greenland look like after decades and centuries of a warming planet? Studying the Scandinavian ice sheet at, and after it's maxima, can be key to understand what is happening at Greenland today.

                                Veafjorden (<b>Fig. 1</b>), located in Western Norway, just outside Bergen, has provided a small puzzle for glaciologist. 
                                The bare rock surfaces on the plateaus around show striations perpendicular to the orientation of the fjord below. The striations indicate that
                                ice has moved across the thousand meter deep through, almost at a 90° degree angle! The question is, what happens to
                                the ice in such a setting? Does it stagnate? Will it slow down? By investigating a small section of the Scandinavian 
                                ice sheet, this project aims to gain a deeper understanding of how ice flows over deep fjords and rough terrain. 
                            <p></p>
                                Similar settings also exist in Greenland today (<b>Fig. 2</b>), but they are hidden under kilometers of ice. Several
                                places close to the Greenland coast have the same surface velocity and ice thickness as that of the Veafjorden 
                                domain.

                                The current simulation ensemble consists of two sets of twelve scenarios. Each with a unique combination
                                of flow direction, surface velocity and ice thickness. In addition, eight control simulations with flat or smoothed 
                                topography are also being executed. Two different ice thicknesses (500m and 1000m) are used, as well as two 
                                surface velocities (450 ma⁻¹ and 850 ma⁻¹).  

                            <p></p>
                                Figure 3 shows the resulting slope values so far. Surface slope (&Theta;) is chosen as a result parameter rather 
                                than velocity itself due to the unique set up of Veafjorden. Slope is linked to surface speed and proximity to 
                                glacier termination.

                                As you might have noticed in the <a href="#">introduction image</a> the most intriguing result is the pattern of 
                                flow. In nearly every perpendicular simulation set up, Veafjorden displays spiraling swirls of slow-moving ice. 
                                Deep in the fjord, ice movement is close to zero meters a year, but the little movement that is present, shows
                                a huge, spiral of ice, moving up and down along the fjord. Ice from along the plateau base, sinks into the deepest 
                                part of the fjord, slowing down almost to a halt. Only to reaper much later on the other side.    
                            <p></p>
                                I'm really enjoying working on this project, and I am looking forward to completing my thesis and see the results in their
                                entirety. Have a look around the fjord from above <b>&#8594;</b>
