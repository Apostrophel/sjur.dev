			<p> I have always had an interest in cameras and film. For as long as I can remember, my father has been 
				showing me and sharing his old equipment. He has tons of cool cameras, objectives and other cool stuff. I never
				really felt the need to capture moments on film, until my friend Marie got me deep into the climbing lifestyle, I wanted
				to document as much as possible. I got a small, lightly used Fuji X100, and took it everywhere. Thousands of 
				pictures (climbing, rocks and nature) later, it didn't function as well as it used to. And I wanted a new challenge. 
			</p><p>
				Analogue photography was the next step. And of course, my father lent me the equipment. He thought me everything
				I needed to know. I experimented with films, filters and a few different cameras. Now I've landed on the Cannon F1
				usually with a 35mm for portraits and people. Sometimes the 50 to get up close and in the dark.

			<p> I love how simple it is to develop black and white. I tend to chose rolls based on that, but
				colors can be great as well. I really like the old Fuji Velvia stock. Colors are strong 
				and purple, perfect for being out in the open, in the deep summer months. They have a unique feel
				to them. 
			</p><p>
				The analogue format has really made me appreciate the art of capturing a moment. You have to be 
				patient and lucky, and even then it's difficult. Luckily, I often like it when the shots are slightly out of
				focus, or even blurry. Faults can give a feeling of surprise, action or novelty. Sometimes mistakes just works out.
